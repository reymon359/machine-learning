# Data Preprocessing Template
# Template with just the basics for preprocessing data

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np #  To work with mathematical numbers.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #  To work with plots
import pandas as pd # To import and manage datasets

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')
# We separate the dependent and the independent variables
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values # Independent
y = dataset.iloc[:, 3].values # Dependent

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)
# test_size is the size of the data that will go to the test set. The rest will go to the training set. (0.2 = 20%)

# Feature Scaling (values in same scale for no dominant variable)
# test set no fit because it is already done in the training one
